NLP-Assignment-2:
This assignment focuses on Aspect Term Extraction, Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis, and SpanBERT Fine-tuning. It is divided into three major tasks:

ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Aspect Term Extraction (35 Marks)
Extract aspect terms from sentences using BIO tagging.

Preprocess data into BIO format and tokenize.

Train RNN and GRU models using GloVe and fastText embeddings (total 4 models).

Evaluate using F1-score (chunk-level and tag-level).

Submit preprocessed data, models, code, and report.

ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (35 Marks)
Predict sentiment polarity for each aspect term in a sentence.

Preprocess data to treat each aspect term as a separate instance.

Train a creative deep learning model (RNN/GRU/LSTM) with GloVe, fastText, or BERT embeddings.

Fine-tune and compare performance of BERT, BART, and RoBERTa.

Evaluate using accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Fine-tuning SpanBERT and SpanBERT-CRF (30 Marks)
Fine-tune SpanBERT and SpanBERT-CRF on a subset of the SQuAD v2 dataset for question-answering.

Extract answer spans from context passages.

Evaluate using Exact Match (EM) score.
